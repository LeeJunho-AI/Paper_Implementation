## VGGNet_Implementation

This implementation is specifically for my personal learning purposes and aiming to enhance my understanding of the VGGNet architecture.

The dataset used in this project is CIFAR-10, and it is noted that the structure of VGGNet has been partially modified to accommodate this dataset.

To run this project, use `main.py` as the entry point.
The implemented configuration of VGGNet is A.
