## Paper_Implementation

This implementation is specifically for my personal learning purposes and aiming to enhance my understanding of the AlexNet architecture.

The dataset used in this project is CIFAR-10, and it is noted that the structure of AlexNet has been partially modified to accommodate this dataset.

To run the project, use `main.py` as the entry point.
